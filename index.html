                I am 38 years old I live in Philadelphia, PA. I have been working in IT for close to 20 years. I
                started off in a data center, moved over to a helpdesk
                and did some desktop support. I moved on to some front end software support and now I am learning front
                end development to help develop the software I've
                been supporting for the last 10 years.
                <br><br>
                In my free time I listen to music and attend concerts. I have been to well over 500 shows. I have some
                some bands over 100 times each. I have travelled all over the US and even followed a band over to
                Europe for 2 weeks. My favorite band is
                Phish, but I have seen Billy Joel, The Police, The Gorillaz.
                Music is a universal language that can bring people from all walks of life together for a little while
                with some common ground, to forget about life for a while and enjoy
                some music.
